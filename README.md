# Bakery_Project
#### Preface:
Hello, this is a data analysis project where I explored and cleaned a sales dataset from a bakery in R and then used the cleaned dataset to create an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Tableau Public. 
The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthieugimbert/french-bakery-daily-sales and the dashboard I created can be found here: 
https://public.tableau.com/views/BakeryDashboard_16713398642680/MonthlySalesDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link.
#### Explanation:
The reasoning for creating this dashboard was to address a fictional scenario in which a bakery has hired a new manager and ownership want the manager to have access to historical sales and trends of the business in an informative, accessible and dynamic format in order to help answer business questions in a data driven management style. Each element of the dashboard is dynamic and will filter the other data in the dashboard depending on which elements the user interacts with. The user can explore sales on a quarterly and monthly basis on the first page in addition to the top ten selling items as gross sales and items sold. The second page allows the user to explore hourly sales and orders trends through any combination of days they want to filter by. 
### I hope you enjoy my work.
